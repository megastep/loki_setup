What needs to be done next :

- Correctly parse options so that they can be given in any order
- Generic compression code (thru a user-defined command)
- Find a way to differentiate between the arguments used by the
  shell stub and those passed to the embedded command (using -- as
  a separator ?)
- Collect names of directories potentially containing md5 program. GUESS_MD5_PATH
