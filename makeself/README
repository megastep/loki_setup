               makeself - Make self-extractible archives on Unix

   [1]makeself.sh   is   a   small   shell   script   that   generates  a
   self-extractible  tar.gz  archive from a directory. The resulting file
   appears  as a shell script (many of those have a .run suffix), and can
   be  launched  as  is.  The  archive  will  then uncompress itself to a
   temporary directory and an optional arbitrary command will be executed
   (for  example  an  installation  script).  This  is  pretty similar to
   archives  generated  with  WinZip Self-Extractor in the Windows world.
   Makeself archives also include checksums for integrity self-validation
   (CRC and/or MD5 checksums).

   The makeself.sh script itself is used only to create the archives from
   a  directory  of files. The resultant archive is actually a compressed
   (using  gzip,  bzip2,  or  compress)  TAR  archive, with a small shell
   script  stub  at the beginning. This small stub performs all the steps
   of  extracting  the  files, running the embedded command, and removing
   the temporary files when it's all over. All what the user has to do to
   install  the  software  contained  in  such an archive is to "run" the
   archive,  i.e sh nice-software.run. I recommend using the "run" (which
   was introduced by some Makeself archives released by Loki Software) or
   "sh"  suffix  for  such  archives not to confuse the users, since they
   it's  actually shell scripts (with quite a lot of binary data attached
   to it though!).

   I  am  trying to keep the code of this script as portable as possible,
   i.e  it's  not  relying  on  any bash-specific features and only calls
   commands that are installed on any functioning UNIX-compatible system.
   This  script  as  well  as the archives it generates should run on any
   Unix flavor, with any compatible Bourne shell, provided of course that
   the compression programs are available.

   As  of  version  2.1,  Makeself  has  been rewritten and tested on the
   following platforms :
     * Linux (all distributions)
     * Sun Solaris (8 tested)
     * HP-UX (tested on 11.0 and 11i on HPPA RISC)
     * SCO OpenUnix and OpenServer
     * IBM AIX 5.1L
     * MacOS X (Darwin)
     * SGI IRIX 6.5
     * FreeBSD
     * UnicOS / Cray

   If  you  successfully  run Makeself and/or archives created with it on
   another system, then [2]let me know!

   Examples of publicly available archives made using makeself are :
     * Game  patches and installers for [3]Id Software games like Quake 3
       for Linux or Return To Castle Wolfenstien ;
     * All  game  patches  released  by  [4]Loki  Software  for the Linux
       version of popular games ;
     * The [5]Makeself distribution itself ;-)
     * and countless others...

Usage

   The syntax of makeself is the following:

   makeself.sh   [args]   archive_dir   file_name   label  startup_script
   [script_args]
     * args are optional options for Makeself. The available ones are :
          + --version  :  Prints the version number on stdout, then exits
            immediately
          + --gzip  :  Use  gzip  for  compression  (is  the  default  on
            platforms on which gzip is commonly available, like Linux)
          + --bzip2  :  Use bzip2 instead of gzip for better compression.
            The  bzip2  command  must be available in the command path. I
            recommend   that   you  set  the  prefix  to  something  like
            '.bz2.run' for the archive, so that potential users know that
            they'll need bzip2 to extract it.
          + --compress  : Use the UNIX "compress" command to compress the
            data.  This should be the default on all platforms that don't
            have gzip available.
          + --nocomp  : Do not use any compression for the archive, which
            will then be an uncompressed TAR.
          + --notemp  :  The generated archive will not extract the files
            to  a  temporary directory, but in a new directory created in
            the  current directory. This is better to distribute software
            packages  that  may  extract  and compile by themselves (i.e.
            launch the compilation through the embedded script).
          + --current : Files will be extracted to the current directory,
            instead  of  in  a subdirectory. This option implies --notemp
            above.
          + --follow  :  Follow  the symbolic links inside of the archive
            directory,  i.e.  store  the  files that are being pointed to
            instead of the links themselves.
          + --append  (new in 2.1.x): Append data to an existing archive,
            instead  of  creating  a  new one. In this mode, the settings
            from  the  original  archive  are  reused  (compression type,
            label,  embedded script), and thus don't need to be specified
            again on the command line.
          + --header
