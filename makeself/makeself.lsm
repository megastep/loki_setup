Title:          makeself.sh
Version:        1.5.3
Description:    makeself.gz.sh is a shell script that generates a self-extractible        
                tar.gz archive from a directory. The resulting file appears as a shell          
                script, and can be launched as is. The archive will then uncompress
                itself to a temporary directory and an arbitrary command will be
                executed (for example an installation script). This is pretty similar
                to archives generated with WinZip Self-Extractor in the Windows world.
