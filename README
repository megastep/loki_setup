The Loki Game Installer 1.2.1
Written by Sam Lantinga and Stephane Peter
------------------------------------------

This installer uses an XML description file to describe a package,
and provides both a console and a GTk front-end to install it.

The installer requires libxml 1.4.0 to parse the XML configuration,
and libglade 1.7 to dynamically load the GTk user interface definition.
Source archives for these libraries can be found in ./libs, and newer
versions may also work.  You should only install static versions of
these libraries, so they will not be required on the user systems.

Building the installer:
Type 'make; make install'
This builds a static version of the console installer, and a dynamically
linked version of the GUI installer, and installs them in the appropriate
CD-image subdirectory for this architecture and version of libc.

The image subdirectory contains a set of files that you can copy to your
CD image, and modify for the game you are distributing.

CD-ROM install file layout:

setup.sh	(A shell script to run the correct setup binary)
setup.data/
   setup.xml            (XML file defining the install options)
   setup.glade          (XML file defining the GTk UI)
   splash.xpm           (Optional splash image for the GTk UI)
   bin/
   bin/<arch>/setup		(Statically linked console version)
   bin/<arch>/<libc>/setup.gtk	(Dynamically linked GTk version)

autorun.inf             (Windows CD autorun file that runs win32/autorun.exe)
win32/
   autorun.exe          (Win32 program that starts up explorer on REAMDE.htm)
   README.htm           (An HTML README file for people running Windows)

--
You should edit the setup.data/setup.xml file to match your product,
and add a new splash.xpm which will be displayed during the install.
There is documentation for the XML setup specification in README.xml

The binaries for your product are expected to be in bin/<arch>/<libc>/
on the CD.  The appropriate binary for the current architecture will
be chosen at install time.  The <libc> portion of the path is optional.
For example, if your binary is called 'rt2', you could have both x86
and PPC versions as:
	bin/x86/glibc-2.1/rt2
	bin/ppc/rt2
and the appropriate binary would be chosen.

The install process creates an uninstall script in the install directory
which can be run when the user wants to uninstall the product.

Make sure you have included installers for the supported architectures
on your CD!  We have included x86, ppc, alpha, and sparc64 binaries for
this version of the installer.

Also included is Stephane Peter's self-extracting archive script in
the makeself subdirectory.  We use this at Loki to generate patches.

Play with it, and enjoy!
