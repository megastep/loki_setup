<H1>Welcome To Linux!</H1>

<P>
You have just bought a game that was specially written for Linux, a free
operating system written by thousands of people all over the world. 
</P>

<P>
If you already have Linux installed, please reboot into it, mount your
CD-ROM with the <EM>mount</EM> command (e.g. <B>mount /mnt/cdrom</B>)
and then read the README file for instructions on installing this game.
</P>

<P>
If you don't yet have Linux, you can buy it from your favorite software reseller or download it for
free.  You can find out more about Linux and where you can download it at

</P>

<P>
Thank you for supporting Linux, games, and free software!
